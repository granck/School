"cmp" function takes 2 arguments ex. cmp eax, ebx
   - means compare eax with ebx. If eax is greater than, less than, or equal to will trigger flags that you use with the next line of command
   - "ja" = jump if a > b, "jna" = jump if a !> b, etc. This is followed by a label to jump to if these conditions are met 
      ex. cmp eax, ebx
          ja L1
      means. "compare eax to ebx. If eax is greater than ebx then jump to L1"
