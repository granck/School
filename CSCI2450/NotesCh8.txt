Stack Frames: Activation record. Every method has a stack frame(Part of the stack belonging to it) but only one stack frame will be active at any particular time.
   A method/procedure call is being made
   1. Argument to pass to next function will be pushed on to  the currently active stack(of the function you are running currently)
   2. Next the address that lets you return to the previous function is pushed on to the stack
   3. Next, the EBP register is pushed to preserve the previous base of the stack. Then EBP is given the value of ESP(to begin the stack for the next set of commands)
   4. Allocate room on the stack for the local variables used in the function that was called
   5. When finished with the function, reset the stack by popping EBP and moving the address into ESP 
   
Passing arguments by value
   Argument values are pushed onto the stack. Return values can be placed into EAX(typical register to use) or pushed on to the stack themselves
Passing arguments by reference
   Offset of the argument(address?) is pushed onto the stack. Can allow direct access to changing variables or avoid having to transfer huuuuge amounts of data such as arrays

Recursion: process of functions calling themselves, creating a "loop" until certain base cases are met

INVOKE directive: allows you to call a procedure and pass the arguments with the call

ADDR operator: returns a pointer to a variable

PROC operator: declares procedure with an optional list of named paramters. 

Multi-Module program: program whose code has been divided up into seperate ASM files.
   - advantages: large programs are easier to work with when divded into separate pieces
