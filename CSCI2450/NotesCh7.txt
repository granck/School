Logical Shift: pushes all bits to the right or left  and adds a zero to the left/right end, pushing the farthest right/left bit onto the carry
Arithmetic Shift: Pushes all bits to the right and fills the left most bit with the original signed bit
SHL Instruction: Shifts to the left instead of the right. Shifting left is multiplying a number by 2. Shifting by n multiplies the operand by 2^n
SHR Instruction: Shifts to the right....divides by a power of 2^n
SAL: same as SHL
SAR: pushes all bits to the right and copies left most bit into the new position
ROL Instruction: Rotate shifts all bits to the left. Hightest bit is copied to carry flag and into the lowest bit
ROR Instruction: Rotate shifts all bits to the right instead of the left. Same principle as ROL
RCL Instruction: Rotate carry left shifts each bit to the left. Copies carry flag to the least significant bit. Copies most significant to carry flag
RCR Instruction: Rotate carry right shifts each bit to the right. Copies carry flag to the most significant bit. Copies least significant to carry flag

MIPS(Multiplication instructions per second): Form of measuring a cpu's performance.
MUL Instruction: Can perform operation on 8/16/32 bit operands, BUT it can only be performed in EAX, AX, AL(That register is implied for all multiplications.)
   DX and EDX can be used to extend the length of these calculations, but it is only used for concatenation
IMUL Instruction: Multiplication on signed values
DIV instruction: Division on 8/16/32 bit operand for unsigned values
IDIV Instruction: Signed division on 8/16/32 bit

Conversion Instructions
CBW: convert byte to word extends AL to AH
CWD: convert word to double word extends AX into DX
CDQ: convert double word to quad word extends EAX into EDX
