- Converting binary/hexidecimal etc.
   (four binary numbers = 16 combinations ,aka, representing 16 numbers)
- Negative bits on a binary number are the first digit on the number. If it is a 1 it is negative. If it is a 0 it is positive
   (This 1 or 0 is lost as it only serves to provide context)
   11001011 = negative number, lose the first 1 and the binary value is 1001011
   01001011 = positive number, lose the first 0 and the binary value is 1001011
   (Same number, but one is positive and the other is negative)
- Two's complement
   Reverse all bits and add 1 to it. 

- byte = 8 bits
- word = 16 bits
- doubleword = 32 bits
- quadword = 64 bits

- Universal character set? = standard ASCII, pronounced as-kee, (0 - 127), extended ASCII goes to 255
- null terminated characters = a sequence of characters that gets ended, the sequence is terminated? New line, etc
